## This project was archived in Jan 2023. Its usage is no longer recommended.


## Why was this project archived?

When BloomRPC was first released in Dec 2018, there were very few GUI gRPC tools available, hence the project tagline: "The missing GUI client for gRPC services". It was a good tool for a few years. Unfortunately, the project stalled in development and issues piled up, leaving users frustrated when things weren't working. We no longer felt that BloomRPC offered a good experience, so we decided to archive it.


## What should I use instead?
